Okay, let's take the quest  walkthrough YAML and re-frame the information it contains using the structure and principles of the "Entity Functional Profile Protocol" markdown document.

Instead of representing the *quest flow*, this new markdown document will present the *functional properties* of the key entities * as demonstrated within the events of that specific quest sequence*. It's important to note that these profiles are based *only* on the information given in the quest text and the general Primal Mama Codex concepts, not a comprehensive definition of each  entity.

Here is the recontextualized markdown document:

## Introduction: Defining Dynamic Potential from Quest Actions

*This document applies the **Entity Functional Profile Protocol** to the events described in "The Final Confrontation" quest sequence within the Primal Mama heterocosm  (as recontextualized from the original quest text). It extracts and defines the **functional properties** of key entities—their demonstrated capabilities, limitations, vulnerabilities, and operational constraints—as revealed through their actions and interactions in this specific narrative passage. This  adheres to Doležel's principle of **textual authentication**, grounding these functional definitions in the provided quest description.*

*Note: These profiles are based *only* on the information revealed in the referenced quest text and the general Primal Mama Codex  concepts, and may not represent the full functional scope of these entities.*

## V. Conclusion: Functional Consistency in Narrative Action

*This application of the protocol demonstrates how the actions and events  of the "The Final Confrontation" quest sequence implicitly authenticate and define the functional properties of the involved entities within the Primal Mama heterocosm. By extracting these demonstrated capabilities and limitations, we reinforce the world's internal logic, ensuring that how  entities behave in this crucial narrative moment is consistent with their established (or newly revealed) potential for action and interaction within the unique, bio-punk Southern Gothic landscape.*

*Future functional profiles for these entities should incorporate this authenticated quest behavior alongside  other sources from the Primal Mama Codex.*

introduction: "This document applies the Entity Functional Profile Protocol to the events described in 'The Final Confrontation' quest sequence within the Primal Mama heterocosm (as recontextualized from the original quest text). It  extracts and defines the functional properties of key entities—their demonstrated capabilities, limitations, vulnerabilities, and operational constraints—as revealed through their actions and interactions in this specific narrative passage. This adheres to Doležel's principle of textual authentication, grounding  these functional definitions in the provided quest description.\n\nNote: These profiles are based only on the information revealed in the referenced quest text and the general Primal Mama Codex concepts, and may not represent the full functional scope of these entities."

# conclusion: "This application of the protocol demonstrates how the actions and events of the \"The Final Confrontation\" quest sequence implicitly authenticate and define the functional properties of the involved entities within the  Primal Mama heterocosm. By extracting these demonstrated capabilities and limitations, we reinforce the world's internal logic, ensuring that how entities behave in this crucial narrative moment is consistent with their established (or newly revealed) potential for action and  interaction within the unique, bio-punk Southern Gothic landscape.\n\nFuture functional profiles for these entities should incorporate this authenticated quest behavior alongside other sources from the Primal Mama Codex."

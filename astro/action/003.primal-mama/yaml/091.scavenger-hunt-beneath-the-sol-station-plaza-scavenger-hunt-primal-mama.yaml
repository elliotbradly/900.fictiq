  introduction: |
    This protocol guides the definition of the **functional properties** of entities within the Primal Mama heterocosm. Following DoleÅ¾el, these properties define an entity's potential for action, interaction, and  influence within the world's established rules (modalities). They encompass **capabilities (abilities, skills, powers)** as well as crucial **limitations (weaknesses, costs, constraints, inabilities)**.

    Focus on **authent icating** these functions clearly and consistently. Define not just *what* an entity can do, but *how*, under *what conditions*, at *what cost*, and crucially, *what it cannot do*. These properties are essential for narrative  mechanics, conflict generation, character agency, and world coherence.

      core_functional_identity: "The sub-structure beneath the Sol-Station Plaza functions as a layered traversal and challenge entity. Its core mechanism is to present interconnected obstacles (navigation, blockages, combat,  puzzles) that the player must overcome using specific authenticated tools, skills, and information found within the area itself or brought with them. Its function is to gate valuable loot (gear diagrams) behind a series of interactive difficulties."
      key_ narrative_functions_served:
        - "Provides a concrete objective and goal (acquiring gear)."
        - "Reinforces the setting's characteristics (decaying pre-calamity tech, presence of spectral entities,  mutated life, requirement for specific tools)."
        - "Creates moments of tension (combat, slow movement speed)."
        - "Offers fragmented lore about the world's past and its current state through documents."
      relationship_to_alethic _modality: "This area instantiates the possibility of hidden pre-calamity infrastructure, the physical manifestation and interaction with spectral entities, the existence of mutated aquatic life forms, the functionality of advanced but retro-styled bio-tech  and temporal manipulation tools (Reality Calibrator, Bio-Kinetic Pulse, Bio-Signature Scanners/Chips, Emitter Arrays), and the existence of valuable, authenticated Gear schematics within the world. It operates within the established rules  regarding entity types, environmental hazards, and technological capabilities."
      key_functional_tensions_trade_offs:
        - "The value of the goal (powerful gear) is contrasted with the cost/effort required to reach it  (navigating hazards, solving puzzles, engaging in combat, dealing with movement constraint)."
        - "The reliance on specific tools creates a dependency and requires prior preparation or finding them within the area, adding another layer of challenge."

   conclusion: |
    This review protocol treats **internal coherence** not as a happy accident or a mere absence of errors, but as a **deliberate creative achievement** resulting from the **consistent and strategic application of textual authentication**. A coherent heteroc osm like Primal Mama, where genetically engineered alligators share swampy lands with Cthulhu-goth witches, where 1970s tech reigns, and where Burt Reynolds is a god, provides the stable foundation for  audience trust, deep immersion, meaningful narrative, and resonant thematic exploration of its unique, bio-punk Southern Gothic landscape.

    Continuously use this protocol to test the structural integrity of Primal Mama. View consistency not as a limitation,  but as the essential craft that makes this imaginative creation truly believable, compellingly bizarre, and enduring.

  - "# Scavenger Hunt  Beneath the Sol-Station Plaza"
  - "We're probably nearing level twenty, or soon will be. Those basic Solar-Woven Hide Suits have served us well so far, but we'll need something stronger, soon , and Enhanced Erpenthrope Stalker Gear might do just the trick... the hide weave is also nothing to turn your nose up at either, being one of the better protective suits in the region... once fully augmented, anyways. This  section will cover getting that gear... and doing a few odd jobs on the side. We should already have the diagrams for the Enhanced Stalker Gauntlets, the Enhanced Stalker Trousers, the Superior Stalker Solar Chopper,  the Stalker Bolt-Caster, the Enhanced Stalker Bolt-Caster, and the Stalker Solar Chopper."

  - "Fast-travel to the \"Beetriot Central Sol-Station\" signpost on Beetriot's main plaza level. From there, head west and down some access  ramps to the north, turning west and descending another series of ramps or lifts immediately after the first towering structure ends. Continue west until you find a cargo ramp going down to the north, and when the ramp ends, head down some grating stairs  to the south, heading downhill along some overgrown service tunnels. When the tunnels end, turn south-west and head around the western side of the structures to the north until the path terminates at a platform ledge overlooking a collapsed section. Drop down  carefully and continue north, then north-east to find a rusted access hatch leading into the old sub-structure."
  - ""
  - "Enter the sub-structure and venture south-east until you find a passage blocked by  what *appears* to be a solid wall of temporal residue or bio-flux discharge. Or the illusions of such, rather. Use a calibrated \"Reality Calibrator\" device to dispel the anomaly and follow the linear path to reach a  large, cavernous industrial chamber. Sadly, this entire area is stupidly treated as a \"hazardous\" indoor environment, meaning travel speed is severely limited by bio-hazard protocols. In this large chamber, you'll find a heavy- duty Gearwright Automaton (Security Pattern - Level 14) skulking around. Dispatch it carefully and have a look around. There are three paths you can take from hereâ€”rusted service tunnels lie to the south and north-east , and to the south-west, you'll find a reinforced hatch which is currently locked by a bio-signature scanner."

  - "**The Southern Conduit**"

  - "Might  as well get to it, then. Head down the southern service tunnel and use a Bio-Kinetic Pulse tool or similar device (authenticated Aard equivalent) on a structurally weak section of wall paneling. Go through the hole in the  wall you made and continue south-west down broken ground to reach some standing water in a flooded section. A waterlogged storage container lies submerged within. Navigate the flooded area to the southern edge and climb up a broken conveyor ramp to reach a  side chamber. Avoid the Mutated Fungal Patches (Temporal Bloom variety) in the middle of the chamber and kill a Lingering Spectral Trace (Level 7) that manifests to challenge you. Then, loot a damaged storage locker along  the southern end of the chamber. Near the locker, you'll also find the note \"Maintenance Log for Security Unit Alpha-7.\""

  - "**The North-Eastern Conduit**"
  - "" 
  - "Backtrack to the main industrial chamber, then head down the north-eastern service tunnel, which shortly turns south-east, then south. Scale some structural ledges, continue south, then turn east and head through a  maintenance doorway to find some faded writing on a steel panel that reads \"Look to the depths to be lifted up.\" Okay, cryptic. Continue east to find some pre-calamity research ruins, which are guarded by another Lingering Spectral  Trace (Level 7). Kill it and search along the north-western ring of the ruins to find some \"Temporal Bloom Research Logs,\" then search south-west of the ruins to find the note \"Bio-Flux Formula\" on a  discarded data console."
  - ""
  - "If you read the logs, you'll discover that whomever was here before us, they were researching Mutated Aquatic Forms, for whatever reason, perhaps related to the Cal amity's bio-fallout or the Temporal Bloom fungus. Turn your attention to the research area nearby and note that there are several heavy, rotating emitter arrays and manual control panels around the outside of the central pit. Your goal here  is to activate the control panels, which adjust the focus of the emitter arrays. Once all the arrays are focused towards the interior of the ruins, you can proceed. Simply activate each panel repeatedly until the emitters all point inward (most need to  be activated twice, but one doesn't need any adjustments at all, perhaps already locked in place). Once they're all focused into the ruins, a section of the floor grate will retract, revealing a deep reservoir of water. Dive  in and kill three Mutated Aquatic Forms (Level 10) with your Bolt-caster, then dive to the bottom and search to the east to find the \"Bio-Signature Access Chip.\""

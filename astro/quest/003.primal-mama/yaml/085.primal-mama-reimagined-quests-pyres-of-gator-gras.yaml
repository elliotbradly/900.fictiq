Talk 'em down (\"Let 's talk\") or fight 'em for the info (\"Get lost\"). Either way, get what you need. \"Eternal Flame\" goons show up, led by that Menge fella. Menge shakes you down and says to back off.\n\nWe need to watch out for 'gator-baiters and  swamp-rats, maybe they know where Trish went.\n\nFirst, check the mess outside Trish's shack, check the bad \"Burt Reynolds is Fake News!\" spray-paint. Inside, activate your Gator-Sense. Find dried swamp-herbs on the floor, check the brush on the  table. Upstairs, loot more, then check the bone-charms. Climb the cypress ladder. Check the swamp-clothes, grab the Gator-Tooth Rosary off the bedside table - Geralt gave it to her back in Lickskillet. Confirms this *was* her place, alright.\n\nOut of  Trish's shack, back to the Hierarch. Geralt spots a 'gator-baiter. Wait near a zone, watch for a swamp-rat to act shady (Gator-Sense is useless here). Follow 'em, keep yer distance.\n\nDown the cypress door, you're bug ged by a swamp-beggar. Pay (20 Gator-Bucks), ask about the \"King of Croakers,\" or tell 'em to get lost. East, drop off the walkway. East through the doors, south, downhill. Watch an exchange, then follow the new target west along the muck- way, then south over the bridge and arch. The stolen 'gator-chips are delivered. Wait, then knock. Bribe the cypress-doorman (50 Gator-Bucks) or use the \"Jerry Reed Charm\" on him (Axii Sign)."

There's other stuff, but *those* are the spots.\n\nFind the brick post, use Gator-Sense to find a  button. Opens a passage to the north. Out into a muck-way, follow it west. Trish talks, cutscene under a bridge. Swim west with Gator-Sense on, find the misplaced Sack. Loot chests on the way. Find the Swamp-Leather Sack near a sunk 'gator-boat.\n \nBack to Trish, hand her the goods, follow her while bantering. Meet the vendor. Trish's unflattering new gig...then head inside the 'gator-chip depot. Trish tells you what to do. East to the wall, Gator-Sense, place the first swamp-trap. North down the stairs , north to the wall, second trap. West, up/down stairs, third trap on the wooden planks. Back to the entrance. Trish casts her illusion, clears the Swamp-Rats.\n\nThe vendor shows up with \"Eternal Flame\" swamp-thugs. He hired Trish, ratted her out, and didn 't pay her.

# Story World Quest Data: Primal Mama - Seeking Enhanced Erpenthrope Weave

Investigation:
  name:  "Seeking Enhanced Erpenthrope Weave"
  suggested_mastery_level: 17
  description: |
    We've navigated the treacherous Bayou paths and dealt with more Feral GE Alligators than  we care to count, pushing us near Mastery Level 20. Our current Standard Issue Security Gear, perhaps with some early bio-mods, has held up, but the unique threats of the deeper swamp require something more specialized. We' re hearing whispers of "Erpenthrope Weave" diagrams â€“ legendary gear said to incorporate the resilience and power of the Beast Men themselves. Specifically, diagrams for the Enhanced Erpenthrope Gauntlets, Enhanced Erpenthrope  Trousers, Superior Erpenthrope Silvered Blade (for spectral/altered threats), Erpenthrope Composite Blade (for physical threats), Enhanced Erpenthrope Composite Blade, and the standard Erpenthrope Silvered Blade  are rumored to be hidden in a dangerous, forgotten corner of the world. This section details acquiring that rare gear... and maybe picking up some intel along the way. Based on recovered fragments, we should already possess the diagrams for the Enhanced Er penthrope Gauntlets, the Enhanced Erpenthrope Trousers, the Superior Erpenthrope Silvered Blade, the Erpenthrope Composite Blade, the Enhanced Erpenthrope Composite Blade and the Erpenthrope Silver ed Blade.

  - title: "Bayou Brawl"
    content:
      - "Talk to the group sitting at the  table in the Juke Joint. One particularly vocal fellow, a local Loresmith, will chase the other two off while passionately discussing the state of affairs. Ask him about his recent 'Whispers from the Weave' correspondence, specifically  what he meant when he mentioned the \"Legendary Erpenthrope\", and chat about Lickskillet's future as far as the encroaching Beetriot influence is concerned. Once that's done, go to leave and he 'll challenge you to a game of Bayou Brawl. For more information on Bayou Brawl strategies, check out the heading \"Bayou Brawl Tactics\"."
      - "Play your first match of Bayou Brawl with the Loresmith. He 's more steeped in lore than sharp tactics, so with any luck, you should win. If you play powerful, diverse unit cards – focusing on High-Strength GE Gators, maybe a well-timed Cattle Artifact card (though careful with  the Axiological balance!), or a solid 70s Automaton – he's got little competitive edge. Just don't play all your cards in one round – you rarely get to draw new cards. If you build up a  comfortable lead (five Strength or more higher) you might just want to pass. This will end the round for you, and there's a chance he'll overspend his hand to win the round, but if he does this on  the first round, there's a good chance he just won't have any cards left to compete with on the next two rounds."
      - "When you win (best two out of three rounds takes the game) you' ll get the \"Swamp Legend\" Card, a Close Combat Card that has no allegiance – it can be played in any deck. Sweet. You can also buy more Bayou Brawl cards from the Tavern Owner – she sells a few, including  another Meat Baron Leader Card, some high-Strength cards with the \"Swarm Link\" special ability (cards that amplify duplicate cards when played together, like Feral Gators or Automaton Units) and a \"Diversion\" card. In  any event, the Loresmith will mention a certain \"Old Man Gator\" you should look up later in your travels. All this starts the quest \"Gather Yer Deck\". Seriously, be sure to buy these cards as soon as you can  – you might not be able to later, and missing out on powerful cards like the \"Diversion\", \"Catapult Rig\", \"Swamp Commando\", and \"Reaver Skiff Crew\" would be a shame."

  - title: "Exploring Whiskey Slough"
    content:
      - " Notice Board"
      - "Leave the Juke Joint, whereupon you'll discover that the swamp thugs who occupied it earlier are waiting for you outside. Hatred of Bayou Prowlers tends to come paired with the lack of sense  to avoid provoking them. And so it is in this case, as well. A fight ensues regardless of what action you pick in response to them, but if you use the Swamp Charm (Axii equivalent ritual) you can earn some extra  experience and take one of them out of the fight. Wisely, they choose fisticuffs as their weapons in this moment, so smack them around."
    objectives:
      - objective: "For using the Swamp Charm on the Thug "
        reward: "40 XP"
      - objective: "For beating up the Thugs"
        reward: "350 XP"

      - "It's  finally time to start exploring – the Beetriot Enforcers can wait, they're not going anywhere any time soon. We'll start with the settlement, where one would expect to receive plenty of work, and then move on to  exploring the surrounding bayou, focusing on points of interest as we go. Whenever possible our area of exploration will be centered around a nearby Travel Marker (which also double as fast travel locations, perhaps salvaged 70s transit hubs), but  when that's not concise enough, geographic features (a derelict processing plant, a deep slough, a settlement) or simple directional bias (the north-eastern edge of the map) will be used."
      - "Any who, first things first, head down the road from the Juke Joint to the east a bit – there are a few containers near the skiff docks worth looting, but as a general rule every box, crate, and sack won' t be pointed out (unless they have something particularly note-worthy inside, of course) – where you'll find your old pal the Huckster. You remember him? He was almost eaten by a Feral GE Gator. Seems he  salvaged some of his stock, but skiff repairs take time and are expensive, so he's eager to sell off what goods he has while he waits. While it's nice to catch up with him, he doesn't really  sell much of interest... unless you have access to the Gator-Hide Gear schematic DLC, in which case, he'll have components or maybe a full set of that gear in his inventory. It's the best starting gear we' ll immediately have access to, and if you've got the Orens, it's worth buying."
      - "Turn around and follow the road west, looting derelict shacks and grabbing swamp herbs as it pleases you.  It's a good way to score some food, crafting components (like salvaged Chrono-Tech bits), and perhaps a few Orens. Posted on a tree to the south of the road you'll find the notice \"Wanted:  Bio-lumina Filament. Will pay top coin. Large quantities welcome. Mamá Root, the Rootworker.\" Good to know."
      - "Continue west until the road forks near a massive, rusted-out automaton shell. At the fork you' ll find the Community Post – that staple of frontier settlements which bestows quests upon us. Even better, just looking at the Community Post (even without taking any of the notices) will update your map with a variety of \"Undiscovered  Locations\". These range from Alligator Nests, Guarded Stashes (often containing pre-calamity goods or salvaged tech), Bootlegger Camps, and other optional places worth exploring to score loot and experience. The notices worth grabbing  are \"Contract: Mire Horror\" which starts a quest of the same name, and \"Bayou Kin Missing\" which starts \"Missing in Action\". If you save and reload your game, new notices *might* appear, but since none  of them start new primary quests, there's not much point in bothering right now."

  - title: "Twisted Chronometer"
    content:
      - "From the Community Post head south to find a very angry  Gearhead cursing as he works at his workshop bench, sparks flying from a sputtering analog welder. Talk to the poor guy and, as one would expect, he's rather snippy. Keep cool and he'll tell you that somebody  set his workshop on fire – an act of arson he feels was brought on by tensions that arose when the Beetriot Enforcers started pushing their authority here. Offer to help him for a price and he'll agree to give you whatever  salvaged tech he has left if you can find the cause of his misfortune. This begins the quest \"Twisted Chronometer\"."
      - "First, note the Enhancement Rig to the north-east. Using it is free, and  will tune your gear, giving you the \"Primed Kit\" boon for 15 minutes (reduces gear degradation or offers small stat boost). Score. Head behind the Gearhead's shack and search to the south-east using  your Bayou Sense to spot some evidence on the ground – perhaps scorch marks with trace biological residue, or misplaced components. Investigate them and Geralt will deduce the arsonist's actions. Further south-east Geralt will find large  footprints, which seem to belong to a substantial individual. Follow them more or less east to a twisted, calcified tree, where Geralt will detect the lingering smell of stale moonshine and bio-waste – a common combination for certain swamp  folk. Keep following the tracks east to reach a muddy path, then north-east until they terminate near a half-sunk swamp skiff. As drunk as our arsonist was, he was at least wise enough to try and cover  his trail. Loot a salvaged crate to the north and pass under a rickety bridge to find where the tracks continue, north of the bridge. Signs of a struggle are noted – apparently our arsonist was attacked by Mire Horrors and lost  his primary Chronometer in the scuffle. The trail continues to the west and onto the road that runs through Whiskey Slough. Follow the wounded arsonist's trail to a shack just south of the Juke Joint."
      -  "Head inside and Geralt will comment that we'll be able to spot our arsonist by the wounds he bears or the missing Chronometer signals. Search the eastern room to find Beau, who is obviously drunk and injured. Talk to  him and he'll confirm the Gearhead's suspicions – a combination of resentment towards off-worlders (Beetriot folk) and hatred of the oligarchy's influence led him to torch the business of someone suspected of collaborating . Knowing that he's in trouble, however, he'll offer to give you some salvaged components or Orens to let him go. If you accept, the Gearhead will be upset you couldn't definitively find the arsonist , but he'll still offer his services to you... which is really the point of all this."
    objectives:
      - objective: "For talking to the arsonist"
        reward: "25 XP"
       - objective: "For letting the arsonist go"
        reward: "25 XP"
      - objective: "For telling the Gearhead about your failure"
        reward: "50 XP"

      - "Alternatively, you can attempt to apprehend him. Doing so will provoke him to attempt to fist fight you. You can indulge him and pummel him into submission, or you can use the Swamp Charm to  subdue him and get him to come along peacefully. In the former case, you'll appear back near the Gearhead, in the latter case, you'll have to escort Beau to him. Either way, the immediate outcome is the  same – Willis calls some Beetriot Enforcers over, who decide Beau's arson constituted sabotage against vital infrastructure linked to Beetriot interests, and set out to apprehend him for summary judgment back in the city. Once they're gone , Willis decides relying on Beetriot might have some benefits after all, and will offer to work his workshop for you."
    objectives_part_2:
      - objective: "For using the Swamp Charm on Beau"
         reward: "25 XP"
      - objective: "For bringing Beau back to Willis"
        reward: "25 XP"
    content_part_3:
      - "One way or another, we  have a Gearhead at our disposal, which allows us to repair our gear, craft new items (if we have schematics), break down old items (like salvaged tech and Feral Gator hides) for components, and of course, peruse  his wares. Dismantling hides, broken tools, and inferior salvaged weapons is a good idea, as it's a fine way to score components at little cost. You also are able to turn more refined components into more generic ones ( Refined Scrap Metal into Raw Metal Chunks, for example), but at this point in time, there's little need to do so unless specifically required for crafting. Consider dismantling all your Salvage/Junk, while leaving Crafting  Components and Alchemy Ingredients (herbs, strange fungi) alone. For more information on crafting, see the section \"Analog Crafting Information\"."
      - "Of particular interest in his inventory are the Swamp Satchels, which will  increase your maximum inventory weight by 30 – a boost of 50%. They cost nearly 200 Orens, however. Also, you might have – or nearly have – the components required to craft the Rugged Gator -Hide Vest, depending on how diligently you looted the shacks in Whiskey Slough. All of this costs Orens however, and right now the best way to earn money is by selling the swamp herbs we pick. They're plentiful , they grow everywhere, and each one is worth a coin. Killing swamp creatures works, too, especially if you use the Bio-lumina Flash (Igni equivalent) to save wear and tear on your weaponry. Or... we could  start exploring those Undiscovered Locations. That's an option, too. There's nothing stopping you from hunting game, killing Mire Horrors, and picking herbs while we explore, either. In fact, it's recommended!  Yeah... let's do that."

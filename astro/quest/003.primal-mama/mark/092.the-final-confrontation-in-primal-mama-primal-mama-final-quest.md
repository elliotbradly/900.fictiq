Okay, let's recontextualize that Witcher 3 quest walkthrough into the bizarre, bio-infused world of Primal Mama, using the elements and rules established  in the Story World Codex. We'll replace characters, creatures, locations, and mechanics with their Primal Mama equivalents while trying to keep the structure and flow of the original guide.

Here is the recontextualized version:

# The Final Confrontation
On Thin Sludge (level 30)
Tell Elder Bayou-Tongue you're ready to confront Bartholomew "Boss" Hoggins, and you'll sail out on the Solar Skiff. No turning  back now. Discuss battle plans, then the Elder will give you one last chance to see to any business you have. If you're ready, agree to go with him. The Elder will operate the Solar Resonator, and for better or worse , you'll get the response you're looking for, drawing out the heart of the Oligarchy's power.

Ciri vs. Dr. Moreau Jr.
As Ciri—or rather, Erpenthrope Unleashed!  (she's fully embracing her beast nature now!)—kill a trio of Oligarch Enforcers (level twenty-nine) then head north-east, massacring all that stands in your way—everything distorted by the Miasma Ble ed. Turn north-west when you must and drop off a sludge bank to find the twisted biotech expert you're looking for. Dr. Moreau Jr. doesn't stand a chance here—hit him three times with Fast Attacks (in beast form?),  then dodge until he bio-phases or reappears, then repeat. When he's wounded you'll get a cutscene.

Geralt vs. Dr. Moreau Jr.
Another straightforward battle—drink a Bio-Stim  (a High-Velocity Gumbo works well) then get to the attack. Use Fast Attacks—Moreau Jr. won't counter your initial strikes, but after you hit him once or twice he'll bio-phase away.  He'll shoot toxic swamp gas blasts or bio-electric arcs at you, either in a wave formation or in succession, which deal moderate decay damage and slow you down. Your Energy Shield (Quen Equivalent) helps, but you' re probably better off just dodging/rolling towards him so you can get back on the attack. Keep the pressure up and fight offensively and you'll be fine. The only other trick he has is to summon a pair of aggressively mutated creatures  (level thirty) like Razor-Maws or a swarm of Vampire Bunnies which can be put down quickly enough—make them a priority when they appear so you can get back to focusing on Moreau Jr.

When the biotech expert falls , he'll make one last desperate attempt to thwart Geralt by deploying a chaotic Bio-Phase Bomb. Swim/pole to the surface from the disorienting sludge and witness another scene then head through the muck, drop down a bank , and run north-west past some Swamp Stragglers who are fighting some Mutated Hounds or Solar-Drained Gators (level twenty-seven). They keep spawning from the Miasma, so there's no point in fighting them all. Drop  down another bank and run across a submerged Solar Skiff or structure trapped in thick sludge, continuing north-east and dropping down a few more banks to find the Oligarchy's Bio-Processing Dredge—Boss Hoggins' massive mobile HQ .

Geralt vs. Boss Hoggins
Board the Dredge to witness Captain "Mama" Dubois fighting Boss Hoggins (in his powered 70s-tech suit), after which Geralt arrives. The two won't  waste much time with pleasantries. Time to show him your Swamp Strider moves. He'll shortly bio-phase or teleport us to a more fitting—and open—processing platform, but if you're quick, you can score  a cheap hit on him before he does.

Hoggins has two attack routines—when he's above 50% health he'll bio-phase about the platform and perform powerful melee combos with his suit's augmented  limbs, although he's not as relentlessly aggressive as Moreau Jr. was. Moreau Jr. was all about chaotic offense and doggedly pursuing your foe. Hoggins is the opposite, relying on power and positioning. Cast your Energy Shield and  dodge/roll around until he appears and starts performing an attack combo, then hit him with a Strong Attack while he's attacking. This will rarely cause you to take a hit, and will typically knock him out of his attack routine. Don' t get greedy and go for more—he'll start blocking subsequent attacks, so just start dodging again. Simply put—dodge, and when he starts attacking, hit him with a Strong Attack, and repeat.

He does have some  more sophisticated attacks, however. Occasionally he'll get some distance on you and summon some Bio-Mines. These mines are easy enough to dodge, typically exploding with toxic gas or ensnaring bio-matter, but dodge (or roll,  or sprint) towards Hoggins while he does this and not only will you evade his mines, you'll be able to score another free hit on him and knock him out of the attack. Other than that, when he's below  50% health he'll add another attack to his arsenal—he'll bio-phase away and slash the platform, sending lines of bio-pulse energy at you. He'll do this three times, in succession, first shooting one line , then three, then five, making the last fairly difficult to dodge, especially if you're too close or too far away.

Deplete his health with the aforementioned Strong Attack and dodge strategy and he'll bio-phase away through  a structural breach. Run to the breach to finish the fight deeper within his Dredge. He'll tell you some unsettling news about the calamity or the Oligarchy before he dies. Guess those "Swamp Strider moves" were too much for the King of  the Meat Oligarchy.

Tedd Deireadh, The Final Bleed (level 30)
Sylvie "The Root" LeBlanc will pull Geral t out of a sticky situation near the dying Oligarch, then talk to him, where Geralt will reveal what Hoggins told him, and Sylvie will make a troubling observation of her own about the Miasma Bleed. Follow Sylvie on foot as the symptoms  of the Calamity's Miasma grow worse, then mount a Solar Skiff when she tells you to. Dodge manifesting temporal echoes, aggressive mutants, and pockets of intense decay as you continue following Sylvie on the Skiff—she does everything  in her power to make this as difficult as possible by navigating like she's guided by spirits.

When you reach your destination dismount and follow Sylvie up a bank/root, then wait for her to cast a protective swamp ward to protect you from the  intensifying Miasma Bleed. Keep following Sylvie, and stay close to avoid taking constant decay damage from the environmental hazard. Along the way you'll have to kill some Mutated Hounds or Drained Gators (level twenty-seven) but they're  a trifling matter by now. You'll eventually reach your destination—the heart of the instability, perhaps the base of the Elder Cypress or a buried Calamity Core Facility—and Sylvie will work her swamp magic—stranding you here  at the source, but giving Ciri a chance to put a stop to this madness.

It Will End in an Ancient Cypress/Calamity Core
Ascend some root structures or access stairs and confront Elder Bayou-Tongue.  Make a pointless timed decision regarding his cryptic pronouncements, then talk to his Oracle accomplice, Maeve. Make a final timed decision, and Ciri (in Erpenthrope form) will head off to confront the source of the Miasma Ble ed directly. She'll remember the confidence-and-doubt boosting moments she had with Geralt throughout their journey, after which the quest "Tedd Deireadh, The Final Bleed" ends, and the quest "Something Ends, Something Begins " starts.

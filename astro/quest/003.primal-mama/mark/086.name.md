Okay, here is the recontext ualized quest text, adapting "Fencing Rosa and Gwenting Roche" into the world of Primal Mama, drawing upon the concepts established in the provided Codex. The core structure and flow are maintained, but the specific entities, locations , and activities are updated to fit the bayou-infused, retro-futuristic, spiritual, post-calamity setting.

# Sparring Rosa and Bog-Boning Roche

*(We need to track down Dandelion –  or his Primal Mama equivalent, perhaps a travelling poet-bard who sings odes to Burt Reynolds? Let's assume that's our ultimate goal. If you want to pursue that directly, skip ahead to finding him. However, there are a few local  situations and encounters we can check out first in the swampy outskirts beyond Beetriot. Our first stop involves a sparring lesson...)*

**Sparring Lessons (level 12)**

Head up to the var Attre estate gate –  perched high above the swamp mist, its 1970s-style retro-futuristic architecture gleaming with faux wood paneling. Talk to the security Automaton outside (try to ignore the faint societal "stain" its presence suggests). It will inform  you that young Mistress Rosa isn't here, but is waiting elsewhere – near the bridge in the Reclaimed Wetlands district that connects towards The Solar Gator Shack, in fact.

Objective	Reward
For talking to the guard Automaton at the var Attre  estate	10 XP

Find and talk to Rosa near the rust-stained, yet functionally elaborate, 1970s-aesthetic bridge. She'll quickly dismiss her human minder, claiming she wants a more authentic locale for her "Gator Gra ppling" lesson than the estate's pristine training grounds – she wants a *real* challenge. She's been practicing a unique bayou martial art focused on subduing or evading the powerful GE gators. Spar with her;  using your full capabilities. Defeat her once again (it should be much quicker now that you're taking it seriously) and she'll yield. Just as you let your guard down, she'll pull a swift, swamp-born  trick, and scamper off into the tall marsh grasses.

Objective	Reward
For sparring with Rosa	25 XP

Activate your enhanced senses (or just look for disturbed mud) to find Rosa's footprints. Seems she dart ed down a soggy path to the south-east – towards The Solar Gator Shack. Head over to the aforementioned tavern, a low-slung building on stilts with solar panels humming on its roof, to find that Rosa's found herself some  typical swamp-dweller "hospitality". Approach the group of rough-looking locals – perhaps smelling faintly of gator grease and swamp rot – and either pick a fight, offer a bribe (maybe some rare pre-calamity tech  parts, or high-quality biofuel?), or use your mental abilities (like the Axii Sign, perhaps re-flavored as a focused push of psychological miasma) to get them to back down. If you pick a fight, put down  a couple of beefy Swamp Brawlers (level nine); if not, move on. Either way, talk to Rosa afterwards and deliver a stern talking-to about the dangers of the swamp fringes. The lesson is definitively over, and Rosa is sent  back towards her gilded cage in Beetriot.

Objective	Reward
For using the Axii Sign on the locals	40 XP
For rescuing Rosa	25 XP

Well, since we're out here in the wetlands, we might as well start  exploring from The Solar Gator Shack. Head east from the inn, possibly poling a small watercraft or navigating muddy trails, and cross a decaying, solar-powered lift-bridge. On the eastern side, turn north into some deeper marshlands where D rowners (level nine), twisted remnants of the calamity, prowl. Kill them, and loot some waterlogged debris and corpses – particularly a figure near a derelict signal flagpost. Once done, head back south and follow the main  water channel or muddy road east.

**Taxes or the Tides**

When you reach a major junction, stick to the northern passage and keep heading east. When you reach another fork, take the southern branch to find some Olig arch Security Enforcers hassling some local swamp gatherers or mom-and-pop gator farmers. These enforcers, clad in functional-yet-boxy 1970s-aesthetic gear, are likely part of the powerful  meat processing oligarchies. You can either wash your hands of the situation (and the peasants' plight), pick a fight with the Enforcers (level thirteen), bribe the guards (100 Crowns feels about right) or use your mental abilities ( like Axii) on them. The last option is often the most efficient. After helping the locals, one will gratefully tell you about something valuable or useful hidden nearby – perhaps a cache of resources, a safe passage through a dangerous zone,  or information about the Oligarchs' activities.

Objective	Reward
For using Axii on the Enforcers	40 XP
For helping the locals	25 XP

**Wary Wayfarers**

From this encounter  follow the path south until you spot a small gathering west of the main route – perhaps huddled around a sputtering bio-fuel generator or sheltering under a makeshift tarp. Accept their cautious invitation to approach, give your name (or lack thereof), and chat with your  temporary companions. Eventually, one of them – a shifty-eyed trader named maybe Marvin – will be a little too specific with his information, raising suspicions with an accompanying Oligarch Watchman. Once these suspicions are raised, the Watchman will attempt to question  or detain Marvin, perhaps suspecting him of being an Automaton user, a carrier of forbidden knowledge, or even tied to the whispered "invisible women" conspiracy. You can either sit the confrontation out, assist the Watchman, or defend  the trader. If you decline to give your name and try to leave when pressed, you'll provoke both Marvin and the Watchman, who accuse you of being an agent of the rival oligarchy, an Erpenthrope spy, or something  worse. The climate of fear and suspicion left by the calamity and fueled by the oligarchic power struggles makes everyone wary.

Objective	Reward
For helping the Watchman subdue the suspected agent	25 XP
For helping the trader fend off the  Watchman	25 XP
For fighting off your accusers	25 XP

**The Bayou Freedom Fighters**

From the site of the wary encounter follow the path south until the route forks, at which point head east. Cross a small wooden  bridge over a brackish inlet, then take the first path south you see and continue south along this trail to find a crudely marked "Gustfield's Landing" signpost (a rusted metal plate with blocky 70s font ). Along the way you can find the remains of stalled watercraft or cargo sleds alongside the route, with some loot scattered near them – just don't expect anything exceptional. When you reach the signpost head along another trail to the north-east through  dense, mosquito-ridden marshlands until you find a similarly crude signpost reading "Bayou Freedom Fighters' Den". Seems kind of silly for such a clandestine group to have a signpost, but... perhaps it's a deliberate mis direction or a morbid joke.

Approach the hidden entrance (maybe disguised as a natural gator den or a cluster of large, engineered mangroves), and a resistance guard, armed with a well-maintained, retro-styled rifle, will attempt to see  you off. Either pick a fight (expect them to be proficient with firearms and swamp tactics), or stick to the top dialogue options until you get the opportunity to use your mental abilities (like Axii) on the guard. After the influence of  a Sign or some good old fashioned thumping, you'll be able to pass.

Objective	Reward
For using Axii on the Bayou Freedom Fighter	25 XP

Inside the hidden location (a dry cave or perhaps a fortified  section of forgotten pre-calamity infrastructure), you'll meet your old friends (recontextualized) Vernon Roche and Ves. The spirit of resistance against tyranny dies hard, it seems, even in this altered world. Ask Vernon about what he' s been through since you last met – and also learn about the collapse of the Old World Order and the brutal rise of the oligarchies in the process. When you're done chatting about the harsh realities of their struggle, challenge him to a game of Bog  Bones. He's got a formidable "Swamp Folk" or "Resistance" deck, including cards like "The Alligator Queen" (a legendary Erpenthrope ally?), "Vernon Roche, Master Tactician" (his leader card,  perhaps boosting swamp units), plenty of "Gator-Mounted Artillery" or "Jury-Rigged Automaton Cannons", which he likes to exploit with his leader ability. He's not above using the odd "Bog Horn" (boost s a row), but he has little in the way of "Agent" cards (Bog Bones' equivalent of Spies) – although he will use "Swamp Mist" or "Alligator Lure" (Decoy equivalents) on your own Agent cards , if he has them handy. When you beat him, displaying your own strategic prowess, you'll add a valuable card to your deck – maybe the unique "Ves, Bayou Brawler" card, representing her fierce combat skills.

Objective	Reward
 For defeating Vernon Roche at Bog Bones	25 XP
Ves, Bayou Brawler Card

After winning, Vernon will mention another player who might be a challenge for us – none other than our fellow investigator/operative, Lambert. To play him  we'll have to advance his quest, perhaps one that requires us to travel to a more dangerous or isolated part of this world – like the deep, haunted marshes where Swamp Witches reside, or across the blighted plains towards forgotten mountain ranges. So,  we'll be putting that off for a while. Time to get back to finding Dandelion and seeing what kind of trouble he's gotten into this time.

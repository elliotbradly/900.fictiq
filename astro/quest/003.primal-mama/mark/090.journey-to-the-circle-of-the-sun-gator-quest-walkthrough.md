## Introduction: Seeking a Cure in the Bayou

*This guide details the critical journey  to the Solar Grotto and the subsequent tasks required to prepare for lifting the curse on Gumbo, a figure afflicted by a strange blight tied to the biological calamity's aftermath or deep swamp magic. This undertaking requires navigating the treacherous bayou, dealing  with local authorities, the distant interference of the Beetriot Oligarchy, and aiding fellow residents of the Grotto â€“ Old Man Bayou, Eskel the Tracker, and Lambert the Mechanic.*

Head up to the **Lickskillet Sheriff's**  Compound. If you haven't visited since the Sheriff took charge (only possible if you dealt with the Specter in the Old Mill) you'll get an update from the Sheriff's Deputy. As tough as the old boss could be, seems the new  regime, tied to the Oligarchy's mandates, is worse. Enter the compound and talk to the Sheriff's Deputy again. You, a hardened bayou operative, don't even try to negotiate and, in the face of an  inflexible and aggressive presence, he wisely concedes **Gumbo** to you. Go the the boathouse and talk to the **Dock Master**, whom you convince with the same rosy disposition you used on the deputy.

 For adopting Gumbo	XP Varies
Once again, however, the **Beetriot Oligarchy** shows up to complicate things, demanding you return to **Beetriot**. Not having much of a choice, you concede. Give your report to ** CEO Augustus Beefheart IV**, and despite your meager results, the Oligarchy will pay you half your reward - **2000 Gator Scrip** - for what you did learn... it's still better than what they had before, after all.  After you're dismissed, you'll talk to **The Swamp Witch**, and they'll agree to meet up at her bayou sanctuary, where you can try and lift Gumbo's curse.

For revealing what  you learned to CEO Beefheart IV	2000 Gator Scrip
**The Solar Grotto** - One Week Later
You - riding your **Swamp-Buggy Scorpion** and with Gumbo in tow - will make it to **The Solar  Grotto**, after a close encounter with a **Sky-Gator**. When you reach the old fortified structure he'll be greeted by **Old Man Bayou**, and it'll shortly become abundantly clear that the Swamp Witch already has reign of the place.  A reign of terror, if you believe poor Old Man Bayou.

We've now got three tasks ahead of us - helping the Swamp Witch, Eskel, and Lambert. Might as well head into the Grotto first, since we're nearby . Explore The Solar Grotto - there are a few **lootable caches** (which mostly just contain repair kits and analog components), then make your way into the main facility, where you'll find Lambert in the main assembly bay.

The Bio -Ampoule (level 19)
Talk to **Lambert the Mechanic** and... well, he's a jerk, as always, complaining about the maintenance protocols. You offer to go with him to the **Circle of the  Sun-Gator**, and Lambert is only too willing to let somebody else carry some of the workload. Agree to go with him, then follow Lambert out of the facility and through a breach in the old containment wall to the north, as  the two banter about events from the **Calamity's aftermath** that left the Grotto in such a compromised state, maybe even hinting at the **origin of the Erpenthropes** or the **deified celebrities**.

Follow  Lambert north and endure more of his chatter about broken tech. Along the way you'll have to fight some **Mutant Swamp Birds** (level nineteen). Eventually you'll find the "Lakeside Landing" signpost, and beyond  it the dock where Lambert moored his airboat... except the tricky watercraft seems to have gone missing.

Head north-west along the shore and kill some **Bayou Abominations** (levels seventeen and eighteen), after which a **Spectral  Manifestation** (level twenty) will show up. Kill them and Lambert will detail the route we'll be taking more thoroughly than he did before, then the two will discuss some of Lambert's difficult past, perhaps his reliance on outdated **Automat ons** and the resulting **stigma**.

Climb into an available watercraft and take a seat opposite Lambert, who will pilot against the waves - and in spite of your complaining and front-seat piloting. Eventually you'll reach a  swamp cave entrance, where Lambert will bring up the legend of **Old Speartip** again before the two hear an odd noise. Choose to investigate the noise, then head west, then north from the cave to find an illusion created by **Sw amp Witchcraft**. Kill a quartet of **Temporal Echoes** (level eighteen) then endure the indignity of Lambert teasing you.

Old Speartip's Mire
Return back south, then east to find the cave, then enter it by heading north -east. Activate your **Night-Sight Filter** (or use a swamp alchemical brew) - if any cave in the game needed one, it's this one - then continue north until you find a more open chamber with a  rockfall obstructing your way. Go around the rockfall to the west to find an abandoned airboat, under which is a cache. More lootables can be found in the murky waters to your east. Approach a high ledge and use your combined  analog climbing gear and physical might to defy gravity.

Scale some more ledges and either use a **Pneumatic Displacer** on a weak section of wall, or refrain and climb a nearby ledge, instead. Continue north to come to another Pneum atic-Displacer-or-climb decision, then continue to the north-east where you'll find yet another decision. Either blast the wall to the north or climb a ledge to the east, then circle around clockwise, cross a jury -rigged bridge, and drop down past the weakened wall.

Either way, continue north-west up a slope, then scale a wall to enter a large chamber where - despite your actions - the **Apex Solar-Gator** sleeps. You can  provoke the Apex Solar-Gator - an enormous, mutated GE Alligator - by simply running up to him, or you can sneak past him by scaling a series of ledges to the north. Why let him live, though? Experience, rare  **solar conduits** and **bio-materials**, and least of all, Lambert's peace of mind are at stake! Either way, scale a ledge to the south-west of where you entered the chamber to find another chamber beyond, in which lie several  lootable caches, including a larger one. Also, beyond (north-west of) the Apex Solar-Gator you can find another large cache. Anyways, loot, then deal with the Apex Solar-Gator (or not). He fights just like any  other colossal GE Alligator, in case you were wondering.

Bog Brute Mountain
Climb the ledges along the northern edge of the Apex Solar-Gator's lair, then follow the linear tunnel to daylight. Lambert will make light of some  **Bog Brutes**, then you will be a sour-puss, as usual. Head up a winding trail to the north to send a Bog Brute running. As you near the cave entrance, more Bog Brutes will show up and  declare this a "Bog Brute mountain." Lambert, exasperated, lets you do the talking... then fails to keep his mouth shut and provokes the Bog Brutes.

Sprint into the cave, then blast a wall to the east with  your Pneumatic Displacer (or Sonic Emitter) and climb a ledge to the south to exit the cave... only to find that the Bog Brutes have headed you off. Either attempt diplomacy (Lambert keeps his mouth shut well enough this time)  or fight them (levels seventeen and eighteen) - you'll have to temporarily surrender your key tech items or display a specific **deified celebrity artifact** to show that you mean them no harm.

The Circle of the Sun-G ator
Do what you wish, then continue along a path to the south to finally reach the **Circle of the Sun-Gator**. After some chatter about the solar alignments and bio-energy flow, activate the **solar conduits** nearby, then  put the **Bio-Ampoule (or Glyph Capsule)** on the altar to charge it with the focused solar energy. While the bio-magic does its job, the two will talk for a bit, after which you'll get the  option to fast-travel back to the Grotto, or stay here. The only reason you might want to stay is to clear out two events in the area... and by "in the area"... well... that's really just code for "north  of the Solar Grotto."

Objective	Reward
For charging the Bio-Ampoule/Glyph Capsule	XP Varies
Guarded Treasure(s) (levels 14 and 20)
If you navigate the  treacherous cliffs south and east of the Circle of the Sun-Gator you can find a Guarded Treasure event on a hill. Kill a **Mutant Flying Predator** (level fourteen) and loot the cache it was lurking near for some tasty  loot, perhaps rare tech blueprints or historical data tapes. The other Guarded Treasure event is along the western shore of the murky lake we just traversed with Lambert, so scale you way down to the south-west where you should be able to find the water craft you took to get to the cave, then pilot it (swimming works in a pinch, but beware the abominations) to an inlet about midway up the western coast. Head into the swamp hills to find a **Bayou Guardian Spirit** (level twenty ). Defeat it, then find the cache it was guarding hidden in a bush.

To Bait a Sky-Gator (level 19)
Let's go help **Eskel the Tracker** out now... The Swamp  Witch, if Old Man Bayou is correct, seems to be in quite a mood. A Sky-Gator might be more agreeable. Leave the Solar Grotto via its western passage and activate your **Bio-Aura Tracker** (or  Spectral Sense Filter) near the "Solar Grotto" signpost. Investigate some **Swamp-Buggy tracks** to update the quest "To Bait a Sky-Gator" then follow them along the road, to the south , across a boggy stream, and finally, as they veer off the road to the south-east. They'll continue past some ruined pre-calamity structures (with lootables around them) before finally you'll see  Eskel's custom Swamp-Buggy, "Scorpion."

Investigate Eskel's temporary camp, then some more tracks on the ground. Follow them until they terminate a short while later, then search a nearby mutated tree to pick up a ** residual energy trail**. Apply some **Bio-Stabilizer Spray** to your weapon, then follow the trail east until you find more tracks, which eventually lead you to Eskel. The two will banter a bit before their prey arrives. Harass the ** Sky-Gator** (level eighteen) until it flies off, then chase it south. When you lose track of it, activate your Bio-Aura Tracker and examine a trail of dripping **solar fluid**, then follow the bleeding Sky-Gator  further south.

Scale some ledges and listen to Eskel chat about the challenges of tracking bio-engineered creatures. Eventually you'll find signs that it landed. Follow the new trail to the north and into a swamp cave. Venture north- east into the cave, then turn south when you must, drop down a ledge, then continue into a small chamber. Loot a cache in a recess to the east, then scale another ledge in the same direction to reach the Sky-G ator's roost. Put the beast down, then collect the specific **bio-components** the Swamp Witch wants from the Sky-Gator (e.g., a Refined Solar Gland).

Note: If you have " Augmented Gear" DLC installed, you can find a cache here with the **Diagram: Augmented Gator-Hide Vambraces** in them.

Leave the Sky-Gator cave and Eskel will challenge you to a race back  to the Grotto. Indulge him or not - he likes to drive slow until he's near the Solar Grotto, so you don't need to gallop your Swamp-Buggy until you cross the boggy stream near  the fort. Even then, the Swamp-Buggy is notoriously unreliable and likes to get spooked by or stuck on the environment, especially when crossing the rickety bridge to the Grotto or going through the main access point. Win the race  and Eskel will give you a reward... but it's nothing major, if you get sick of the Swamp-Buggy constantly throwing the race at the end.

Objective	Reward
For beating Eskel at a Swamp-Bug gy race	XP Varies
Bayou Drifter Boots
For slaying the Sky-Gator	XP Varies
